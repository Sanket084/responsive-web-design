## Basic JavaScript

### 30/04/2024

Implemented use of random function and parsing functions
- generating random fractions using
  - Math.random()
- generating whole numbers also within a range
- parseInt()
  - parseInt() - to convert a string into an integer
  - parseInt(a, b) - to convert string to integer with radix, where b is the base
- Recursion to Create a Countdown exercise
- Recursion to Create a Range of Numbers exercise
This marked the end of the Basic Javascript chapter, next chapter will be ES6

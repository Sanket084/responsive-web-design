- Colors can be defined by 3 ways
	- Color names — example: red
	- RGB function — example: rgb(255, 255, 255) 0 being darkest value, 255 being the brightest value
	- HSL function — example: hsl(240, 56%, 42%) hue | saturation | lightness
	- Hex function — example: #f7f7f7 denotes RGB values in hexadecimal
